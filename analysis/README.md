# Active Search EEG and Eye Movements Data Analysis

Welcome to the repository for analyzing EEG and eye movements data! This repository contains code and resources for performing advanced analysis on preprocessed EEG and eye movements recordings.

## Overview

The analysis code provided in this repository is intended to be used after completing the preprocessing stage of the EEG and eye movements data. It offers a comprehensive set of tools and techniques to explore and extract meaningful insights from the synchronized EEG and eye movements data during a Visual Search experiment

## Key Features

- **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed EEG and eye movements data, such as eye fixation durations, saccade amplitudes, trial numbre, rank order, and more.
- **Fixation-Related Potentials using regressions (fFRPs)**: Perform FRP analysis to investigate evoked brain responses in relation to specific events or stimuli during the task (Unfold Toolbox).
- **Data Visualization**: Utilize visualization techniques to generate informative plots, heatmaps, topographic maps, and other visual representations for better understanding and interpretation of the data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conduct statistical tests based on permutations (TFCE) testing to assess the significance of observed effects or differences within the data (Mensen implementation).

## Getting Started

To get started with the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Preprocessing: Ensure that you have completed the preprocessing stage 1-8 of the EEG and eye movements data. If not, refer to the preprocessing scripts.

2. Data Import: Use the provided code to import the preprocessed data into the analysis environment. Make sure to organize the data in the required format and structure as specified in the documentation.

3. Code Execution: Execute the analysis code scripts, starting with the relevant import of lybraries needed and the specification of the paths for the data and code folder. Feel free to modify the code to fit your specific needs.

4. Result Visualization: Utilize the visualization functions and scripts to generate the informative plots found in the paper. Customize the visualizations as needed to communicate your findings effectively.

5. Statistical Analysis: The last stages include TFCE method to appropriate statistical tests the results to quantify the significance of observed effects, differences, or relationships within the data.
